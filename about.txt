I'm Zijing.
I'm from Beijing, China.
I was a business developer in an IT startup, now I'm trying to survive till Xmas in Ironhack DA bootcamp.
I had few experience with tech & data, R language, python, sql, excel.
I want a change in my career, using data to help make a better business decision.
Destiny brought me to Ironhack?
I expect to learn as much as possible in Ironhack, all related and not limited to data analytics.
I will find some practical opportunity to apply my skills in a real business scenario.
Industry not quite limited, IT, FMCG, banking, finance, whatever
Future role, emmm not quite clear yet, but definitely using analytics skill and combine with business insight. 
Career goal: well, be rich and free? ahaha
